Welcome

Successfully automating your machines in the cloud using Ansible. Start with
the bascis of 'ssh' to access the machine, build up to Ansible modules, and
then playbooks. You will progress to roles and custom modules for better
organization.


Videos of Talk
--------------

Even though the exercises have been updated to work with modern versions of
Ansible and Python 3, there are currently no videos to match the exercises.
There are videos, however, from 2014 for basic concepts:

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The exercises in this repository have been tested against an Amazon AMI. The
decision to use an Amazon instances are:

* They are kept current by Amazon

* They are very cheap to spin up to do a test (less than 4 cents for this
  training session). Free if it's an Amazon account that is less than 1 year
  old. *Please remember to TERMINATE your instance when finished*.

* We are using 'yum' as a package installer in the earlier exercises (to keep
  different variations at a minimum). We later learn how to be more universal.

* We need a standard to avoid the complications of too many choices to configure

You are welcome to use any host that you wish for these exercises. However, to
avoid confusion where playbooks will not work (e.g., package names differ, yum
isn't supported, etc.), I suggest that you use:

*Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-00eb20669e0990cb4*

The *t2.micro* size is sufficient for these exercises and is what is used for
testing.

Talk description
----------------

As we have seen with the previous talk, "Red Pill, Blue Pill Virtual Machines
and Virtual Environments" (`GitHub
<https://github.com/glenjarvis/red-pill-blue-pill>`_ / `YouTube
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZb3cr1JrMg>`_), we can create virtual machines
in the cloud.

But, how do you "stamp" those machines differently? If you need to build a web
server, mail server, DNS server, and load balancer, each machine may have the
same base image but needs to be configured differently.

If you manually configure those machines, what happens when you suddenly have a
surge in traffic and need four more web servers? Or, what if one finds a
vulnerability in a library like `Heartbleed
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed>`_ in OpenSSL? A very safe option would
be to rebuild these machines from scratch. If they were built manually,
rebuilding these machines within minutes from scratch would be daunting, tedious
and error prone.

There are several tools that have been built to fix this problem. Two of the
most popular tools, `Chef <http://www.getchef.com>`__ and `Puppet
<http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet>`_, are written in the `Ruby
<https://www.ruby-lang.org/>`_ programming language. And, especially for the
most popular, `Chef <http://www.getchef.com>`_, one needs somewhat of a
familiarity with that language to use the tool.

There are two more tools that are written in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
and are growing in popularity: `Salt <http://www.saltstack.com/>`_ and `Ansible
<http://www.ansible.com/>`__.  `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/>`__ requires
the least amount of set-up (if any) and has the simplest infrastructure (it
simply uses commands over ssh like `Fabric <http://www.fabfile.org/>`_ does).
`Ansible <http://www.ansible.com/>`__ is the easiest tool to get started with if
you are new in the machine build automation frameworks.

We will start with a newly built machine and obtain it's public IP address. We
will configure the `ansible_hosts` file with the IP address, and add/build plays
(like recipes) to gradually configure that machine so that it is a
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ web server running in the cloud. When
we are finished, we should have a running machine and a recipe to easily build a
seconded machine with a few keystrokes.

P.S. If you haven't previously built an `Amazon Web Instance
<http://aws.amazon.com/>`_, I highly recommend `watching this video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmNgXQXkpWs>`_ in advance of the talk.


Getting Started (Installing and following-along)
------------------------------------------------


1. Clone this repo to the directory you would like to have your work in.

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ git clone https://github.com/glenjarvis/ansible_hands_on_training.git
       Cloning into 'ansible_hands_on_training'...
       remote: Reusing existing pack: 112, done.
       remote: Total 112 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
       Receiving objects: 100% (112/112), 37.58 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
       Resolving deltas: 100% (48/48), done.
       Checking connectivity... done.


2. Make a virtualenv named **venv** for your Python environment of choice.

    * For Python3::

        $ python3 -m venv venv

    Note:  Python 2 support has been dropped from this project. Only Python 3
           is supported.

3. Activate the Virtual Enviroment. Every time you come back to work on this
   project, you will need to activate your virtual environment::

       $ cd <full path to this repo>
       $ source venv/bin/activate

   When the Virtual Environment is activated, you should see ``venv`` in the
   prompt. It may look something  to this::

       (venv) $
   
   (OPTIONAL)
   I often like to be able to jump to this folder quickly from
   anywhere and have it automatically setup my virtual environment.
   So, I put something like this in my ``$HOME/.bashrc`` (or equivalent)
   file:

   .. code-block:: bash

       function cd_ansible_hands_on_training {
           deactivate 2> /dev/null
           cd /FULL_PATH_TO_THIS_DIRECTORY
           source venv/bin/activate
       }

4. Upgrade Pip. The Pip that comes with a new Virtual Environment is often too
   old. Upgrade it to be sure it is current:

   .. code-block:: bash

       (venv)$ pip install --upgrade pip
       Collecting pip
         Using cached https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/0f/74/ecd13431bcc456ed390b44c8a6e917c1820365cbebcb6a8974d1cd045ab4/pip-10.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
       Installing collected packages: pip
         Found existing installation: pip 9.0.3
           Uninstalling pip-9.0.3:
             Successfully uninstalled pip-9.0.3
       Successfully installed pip-10.0.1


5. Configure the repo for your account and settings

   .. code-block:: bash

       (venv)$ ( cd src; python configure.py )

       This script creates configuration files for using Ansible to
       configure a newly-created virtual machine.
       It has been tested by the author on an AWS free tier VM.
       This has the best chance of working on an AWS free tier VM, or
       failing that, on a VM with a recent version of CentOS.

       No configuration file found. Let me ask questions so that we can configure.

       What is the path to your .pem key file for  the virtual machine?
       --> ~/example_key.pem

       What user to use to ssh to the remote system [ec2-user]?
       -->
       Configuring `ansible_hosts` file ./ansible_hosts...

       What is the IP address of the virtual machine?
       --> demos.glenjarvis.com

       Configuration is complete.

6. Follow the examples (starting with the ``example_01`` subdirectory).
