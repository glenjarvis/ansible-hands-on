The training wheels are off!
============================

In demo_playbook_iter_01.yml through demo_playbook_iter_09.yml, we start using
Ansible playbooks (and start combining them in different combinations).

pedantically_commented_playbook.yml is just a sample to show how many features are in a
playbook. It's stale information, but still informative.
